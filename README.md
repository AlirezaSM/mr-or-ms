# Mr. or Ms. ?

This is a website that can genderize any given name based on [Genderize API](https://genderize.io/) or pre-saved local data. It was implemented for the midterm exam of the Internet Engineering course at my university.

# Features
- The response will only be returned if the given name exists in the browser's local memory.
- Otherwise, the website uses the API for the answer.
- You can save the perceived answer in the browser's local storage.
